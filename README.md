# DBG_threads - Multi-threaded Program Monitor & Analyzer

Automated system for testing and monitoring multi-threaded C++ programs with performance metrics collection, deadlock detection, and data race detection.


## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Potato3852/DBG_threads
cd DBG_threads
chmod +x run.sh
```

# Run all files in cpp/ with default settings (4 threads)
```bash
./run.sh
```

# Run with N threads(for example 12)
```bash
./run.sh 12
```

# Run specific file(choose your files after number of threads in <name> or <name>.cpp format)
```bash
./run.sh 8 race_demo
./run.sh 4 normal.cpp deadlock_demo.cpp
```

## Smart compilation - recompiles only when source changes

### Performance metrics via perf stat:

Wall time & CPU time

CPUs utilized & Parallelism

Thread efficiency (% of theoretical max)

CPU usage (% of single core & total system)

### Deadlock detection - monitors /proc/[pid]/task/ states

Detects in ~1.5 seconds

3 consecutive checks = confirmed deadlock

### Others:

Data race detection - analyzes program output

Flexible execution - run all files or specific ones

Progress visualization - real-time monitoring with progress bars

Auto-reports - saved in results/report.txt

## Example Output

# Dataset
We use dataset from https://github.com/JaKooLit/Wallpaper-Bank/
Thank you a lot!!!

# FAQ
Q: Why no metrics for deadlock_demo?
A: The program terminates too quickly (~1.5s). Perf needs minimum time to collect accurate metrics.

Q: How to add my own demo?
A: Just add a .cpp file to the cpp/ folder. It should accept thread count as first argument.

Q: Why does it say "Very low CPU usage"?
A: This is a warning when a program runs >3s but uses <5% CPU - could indicate inefficiency or deadlock.

Author`s comment: The file system_monitor.py is not in use now, because I switched to a simpler solution, but I left it as a memento of the previous Legacy version.
